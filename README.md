# Phone-Directory-System
The **Phone Directory System** is an efficient contact management application that utilizes fundamental **data structures** to organize, retrieve, and manipulate contact information. The system leverages a **doubly linked list** to store contacts, where each node contains the contact's name, phone number, and pointers to the previous and next nodes, enabling efficient bidirectional traversal. Contacts are stored in alphabetical order, ensuring easy access and improved organization. Additionally, a **stack** is used to implement an **undo feature**, allowing users to revert their most recent actions, such as adding or deleting a contact, through a simple **last-in, first-out (LIFO)** mechanism.

A **priority queue** tracks the **most accessed contacts**, using an unordered map to maintain access counts. This feature highlights frequently searched contacts, enhancing user experience. The system also includes **bubble sort** to keep the contact list alphabetically ordered and offers key functionalities like adding, deleting, updating, and searching for contacts. These data structures work together to provide an intuitive and feature-rich interface, demonstrating how practical applications of linked lists, stacks, and priority queues can efficiently solve real-world problems in data management.
